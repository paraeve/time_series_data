This repository contains models I had tried to play with time series data. 
I will add note for the comparison of each model. I don't have intention to compare the perfomance or try to make benchmark work. The note will focus more on the what we need to pay attention to when implementing these models for different types of time series data. This will be done by explaining the data pre-processing and math behind different models.

Language: Python 2.7
